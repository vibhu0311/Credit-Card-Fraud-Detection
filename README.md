# About

This project explores a dataset given on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The goal is to detect fraud credit card transactions. 

The dataset is highly imbalanced and thus provides us with the opportunity to explore imbalanced-learn library which has APIs for both over-sampling and under-sampling.
